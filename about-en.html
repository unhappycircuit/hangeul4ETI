                    ＜Interstellar Message Written in Hangeul＞ is a new interstellar message designed to communicate with extraterrestrial civilizations that utilize radio communication. In particular, this message is the first Interstellar message to apply Korean grammar and letters, Hangeul, as an attempt to deliver the Earth's natural language to extraterrestrial intelligence. This is an effort to more systematically convey information about the language of the Earth towards the unknown, and at the same time emphasize the importance of reflecting the diversity of languages and letters on the planet, including Korean and Hangeul, in designing interstellar messages.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                    The overall structure of this message is based on ＜Cosmic Call＞ in 1999 and 2003, but the overall contents have been revised and new contents have been added. Above all, this message is significant as the first attempt to combine the prior interstellar message, which was studied mainly on the expression of the Latin alphabet and mathematical symbols, with the Earth's natural language.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                    In particular, this message excludes the use of Chinese characters, Hanja, expressions, which occupy a large portion of modern Korean, and applies newly designed pure Korean expressions. Most of the mathematics and scientific terms used in Korea use Hanja expressions, but the pure Korean expressions used in this message conveys the meaning of the term more easily and clearly than Hanja expressions. As a result, it effectively reflects the advantages of Hangeul letters. Without using pure Korean expression, chemical elements and units of measurement were written based on the Korean chemical nomenclature and the International System of Units.

                    This message was structured in a way to define information about Earth, humans, and language step by step based on basic concepts of mathematics and science. In other words, It is composed of a structure that allows you to understand the next content if you understand the previous content. By following this message step by step in order, extraterrestrial scientists and linguists can understand the meaning of messages.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                    As expressed by Dr. Yvan Dutil, who designed ＜Cosmic Call＞, this message is “Interstellar Rosetta Stone” written in Hangeul that contains brief and essential information about the knowledge and language of the Earth. Above all, in the last paragraph of this message, there is a one sentence that reflects our human beings. This last sentence is the message from humanity to outer space, and at the same time, it is the message directed to ourselves, humanity.

                    <p>
                    The website of ＜Interstellar Message Written in Hangeul＞ was first released on Hangeul Day on October 9, 2020. In addition, the ＜Interstellar Message Written in Hangeul＞ was simultaneously produced as an audiovisual installation and exhibited at the National Library of Korea and Hyundai Motor Group’s ZER01NE Studio in 2020.

                    Unhappy Circuit is a contemporary new media artist in Korea. His works take a multidisciplinary perspective based on astronomy, biology, data science and linguistics. Basically, he has a strong curiosity about other intellectual beings such as artificial intelligence, whales and extraterrestrials. Based on this curiosity, he is trying to explore and truly understand them through his works. By exploring non-human beings, he wants to expand the scope of humanity. And through this, he ultimately seeks the next direction for our civilization to go forward.

                    From an audiovisual installation that mediate human language and computer language (＜Music of Memories＞, Asia Culture Center, 2017), an audiovisual installation asking questions about the identity of artificial intelligence that learned human memory (＜i Remember＞, Arts Council Korea, 2018), a performance that cooks a new food recipe created with artificial intelligence (＜Learning About Humanity＞, Asia Culture Center, 2019), a piece of music created with artificial intelligence that synthesizes sound of blue whale and human music (＜A Synthetic Song beyond the Sea＞, Art Center Nabi, 2019), an audiovisual installation of radio signal data to search for extraterrestrial intelligence (＜A Letter Across the Stars＞, SIGGRAPH Asia, 2020), and until designing a new interstellar message for communication with extraterrestrial intelligence (＜Interstellar Message Written in Hangeul＞, National Library of Korea, 2020), His work connects language and music, memory and data, and humanity and the universe.
